# Leetcode-BitManipulation
Covers all the Bit Manipulation problems on Leetcode

Specific Problems 

1. Single Number I (Prob 136)
2. Single Number II (Prob 137)
3. Majority Element (Prob 169)
4. Bitwise And of Range Numbers (Prob 201)
5. Counting Bits (Prob 338)
6. Hamming Distance (Prob 461)
7. Decode XORed Permutation(Prob 1734)
8. Rock and Lever (Codeforces)

Prerequisites:

1. Basic Bitwise operators &,|,~,^,>>,<<
2. Find if given number N is power of 2 -> (return n&n-1==0)
3. Count number of 1's in Binary representation of a number - Brian Kernighan's algorithm
4. Check if ith(starting with 0th bit from right) bit of a number is set (n & 1<<i!=0)
5. Generate all possible subsets of a set using bitmask
6. Find the largest power of 2 which is less than or equal to the given number(O(1) solution is needed,Rock and Lever problem)
7. Boyer - Moore's Voting Algorithm (Majority Elements)
